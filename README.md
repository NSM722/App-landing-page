Exercise from the Responsive Web Design course at [Sololearn](www.sololearn.com)

Responsive web design is the practice of building websites that can adapt to every device and every screen size. 

During this course, I learned how to build modern, responsive websites using HTML and CSS. 

As per the course project, I built a website from scratch and, as a bonus, added some functionality to it using jquery at the end of the course.

Clicking on the download button will produce/fade out two links and clicking on it once more will cause the links to dissapear/fade in.
