Exercise from the Responsive Web Design course at Sololearn - www.sololearn.com

Responsive Web Design
Responsive web design is the practice of building websites that can adapt to every device and every screen size. 
During this course, I learned how to build modern, responsive websites using HTML and CSS. 
As per the course project, I built a website from scratch and, as a bonus, added some functionality to it using JavaScript at the end of the course!
